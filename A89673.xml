         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k of <hi>Scotland</hi> were with the King, and had conference with his Majeſty concerning divers things in matter of conſcience; for his Majeſty propounded ſome things concerning the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and alſo the propoſitions, which he ſaid he could not in conſcience p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe; but the conference was ſo private that I cannot give you the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of it, and will not write by hereſayes leſt I ſhould miſtake.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:159889:3"/>
            <p>On Thurſday the 10. Inſtant, the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Eſtates of Scotland were with the King, and they have been often with His Majeſtie, and divers Poſts have been ſent to and fro, between here and Scotland, with packets; His Majeſtie hath of a few dayes paſt uſed but little paſtime, by reaſon of much time taken up in conference, and privaſie, there was ſome ſpeech amongſt us as if the King would take the Covenant and ſigne the Propoſitions, but I know not upon what grounds that rumor was raiſed, nor was there any reaſon (that I could learne) to expect it by reaſon of any promiſe from His Majeſtie, onely a kind of waving it till Montrill came.</p>
            <p>On this preſent Fryday the 13. the Scots Commiſſioners here received letters from the Commiſſioners at London; upon reading, and peruſuall whereof they were very buſie; how things paſſe there I ſhall not need to write to you, being better acquainted therewith then my ſelfe; The Country all about in theſe parts deſire to be eaſed of the Souldiers; ſome long in daily expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, others are ſadded between doubts and feares.</p>
            <p>We had alſo letters from Scotland, whereby the Commiſſioners were ſent for to a generall meeting of all the Eſtates, and Gentlemen of the Kingdom, the meeting is by authoritie of a former Act, the buſineſſe they meete about is to conſider in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentorie way, of all ſuch things as ſhall be

            <p>Some other particulars I have to write unto you, which are of importance, but require no ſuch haſte but that I may take a little more time, which to the end that I may be the more large in, I ſhall deſire you to be ſatisfied with theſe few lines (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next oportunity, which God willing I ſhall not faile you of more large, then now by reaſon of many buſineſſes I can any wayes contract further times at preſent to do more in) having much adoe to performe this.</p>
